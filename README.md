mhacks-fall13
=============

This website allows users to input a melody using their keyboard and get back a chord progression that fits that melody in return.

It's the first python site any of us have done; it was developed in 3 days at MHacks Fall 2013, with bugfixes afterward.

It used to be hosted at http://biggerfisch.us.to/keyboard 

The server is currently down :(
